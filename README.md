## Installation 
This is a full stack application so it is running 

```md
npm start

With that being said I will go one by one with the proper dependency installations that must take place :old_key:

Express 
```md
npm i express
```

Dotenv
```md
npm i dotenv
```

Sequelize
```md
npm i sequelize
```

Handlebars.js
```md
npm install handlebars
```
Masonry 
```md
npm install masonary-layout 
```

## Future Development 
This application is amazing and we feel accomplished to be able to get it to this level within 2 weeks. However there are some components that will be a work in progress. 

Stay tuned for updates as I’ll be adding onto this project for my portfolio
